# shoe_distribution

* Application Name: Shoe Distribution
* Author Name: David Fung

## Description: Write a program to track shoe brands and what shops they are in. Here are the user stories:

* As a user, I want to be able to add, update, delete and list shoe shops.
* As a user, I want to be able to add and list new shoe brands.
* As a user, I want to be able to add shoe brands in the application (don't worry about updating, listing or destroying shoe brands).
* As a user, I want to be able to add existing shoe brands to a shop to show where they are sold.
* As a user, I want to be able to associate the same brand of shoes with multiple shops.
* As a user, I want to be able to see all of the brands a shop sells on the individual shop page.
* As a user, I want shop names and shoe brands to be saved with a capital letter no matter how I enter them.
* As a user, I do not want shops and/or shoe brands to be saved if I enter a blank name.

## Development:
Further development can be done based on the following steps inside Ruby environment:
* `git clone <repository-url>` this repository
* `cd shoe_distribution`
* `bundle install` to install the gem files
* `rake db:create` to create database
* `rake db:migrate` to add database tables
